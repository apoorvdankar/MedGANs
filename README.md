# MedGANs

## Introduction 

The main idea of the project was to come up with a pipeline which takes input as a medical image directly from the instrument and outputs an enhanced image which is denoised and edge preserved. This is done through implementing generative adversarial networks to denoise the image to minimize the blurring effect common in traditional methods.
